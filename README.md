# Factory-Method-Pattern-Appearance
code indeed implements the Factory Method Pattern. Here's how it aligns with the pattern:

Abstract Factory (CharacterFactory): The CharacterFactory class is an abstract class that declares the factory method createCharacter(String name).

Concrete Factories (WarriorFactory, MageFactory, ArcherFactory, ThiefFactory): Each concrete subclass of CharacterFactory (e.g., WarriorFactory, MageFactory, etc.) implements the createCharacter(String name) method to create specific types of characters.

Client (main): The main class acts as the client. It creates instances of concrete factories (WarriorFactory, MageFactory, etc.) and uses them to create different types of characters.

Product (Character): The Character class represents the product created by the factory method. It encapsulates the character's properties such as name, appearance, abilities, equipment, and attributes.

Creator (CharacterCreator): The CharacterCreator class serves as a helper class to manage the creation of characters. It sets the concrete factory and invokes its createCharacter(String name) method to create characters.
